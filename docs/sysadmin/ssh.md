# SSH
Because I do _just_ enough with remotes that I should use some common sense.

## Key setup
* [Transfering keys with ssh-copy-id](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id)
  * Helpful `ssh-copy-id -i PUB_KEY -o PubkeyAuthentication=no user@ip_address` to use password

## Security
* [Lawrence Systems: Configuring SSH FIDO U2F Authentication with YubiKey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjDFk8xdtGw) (YT video)
