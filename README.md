# homelab-notes
Building a homelab is hard work. I'm taking notes :)

## Why a homelab?
I want to learn more about what sysadmin and cyber security folks do. Preferably in a [fail-safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-safe) environment. A homelab gives me a space to meet both of those broad goals. If I bork a setting or a VM, I can roll back to a known good state and try again.

This homelab project also gave me a chance to build my first computer. I sourced parts from PC Parts Picker, and only made a few mistakes along the way.
